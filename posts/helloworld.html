<h1>Hello World!</h1><h2>This is sanj0 (Malte Dostal) on his new blog!</h2><p>cats: special
Hello, World! Thank you very much for showing interest in my latest project, this blog. If everything goes to plan (which it normally doesn't for my projects), I will be posting weekly updates of my multi-media adventures (which mostly consists of coding) and zero or more intermediate, small updated for when I discovered something interesting or implemented a nice feature. Or hopped on a new side project that will be abandoned two days later.<p>This is written in markdown (currently using <a href=https://www.obsidian.md>Obsidian</a> and <a href=https://www.atom.io>Atom</a>) and then parsed by a self-written java program. The resulting html data is placed into a template and categorised by the tags that were parsed from this very markdown file but ignored by the html converter. Naturall, I <strong>have to</strong> try if the <em>formatting</em> actually ~~works~~, which it actually seems to. Here is a list of nothings:<ul><li>nothing<li>nothing, again<li>nothing, but cooler</ul><p>and now we rank them:<ol><li>nothing, but cooler<li>nothing (because it's original)<li>nothing, again (copycat)</ol><p>After this initial success of parsing the markdown to html (btw using <a href=https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-java>CommonMark</a>) and deploying it to my website, categorising etc. will soon follow.
